# Lerna

## Commands

`npx lerna init` start a new project or convert existing. can then just use `lerna` once it's in /node_modules/.bin

or install globally `npm i -g lerna`

`lerna bootstrap` - install dependencies and link local dependencies
`lerna clean` - delete dependencies
`lerna create` - add new module

`lerna run build --stream` sequential
`lerna run test --parallel` self explanatory

## Notes

to use with yarn/workspaces

```
// lerna.json
+  "npmClient": "yarn",
+  "useWorkspaces": true
```

all workspaces/packages in `./packages/foo`
subdirectories seem to work, e.g. /packages/lib/logger /packages/service/foobar

although it's easier if they are just in /packages/whatever, flat means less config

`npx lerna bootstrap` for initial install

then `lerna [whatever]` after

command.version.ignoreChanges: an array of globs that won't be included in lerna changed/publish. Use this to prevent
publishing a new version unnecessarily for changes, such as fixing a README.md typo

```json
{
  "packages": [
    "packages/*"
  ],
  "npmClientArgs": [
    "--no-lockfile"
  ],
  "version": "independent",
  "command": {
    "version": {
      "ignoreChanges": [
        "*.md"
      ],
      "npmClient": "npm",
      "message": "chore(release): publish"
    },
    "publish": {
      "npmClient": "npm"
    }
  }
}
```

```json
{
  "extends: "../../tsconfig.build.json",
  "compilerOptions": {
    "rootDir": "./src",
    "outDir": "./dist"
  },
  "include": [
    "src/**/*"
  ]
}
```

For each tsconfig, we have to declare the rootDir, outDir , include properties. They canâ€™t be hoisted in the root config
because they are resolved relative to the config they are in.

## packages

### common

exports a string

should be importable by other packages

### foobar

like a pretend service, imports the logger and the string from common and logs the string

### logger

exports a logger function, should be importable everywhere
