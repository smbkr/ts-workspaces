## Yarn 2

https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install
```
nvm use
corepack enable
yarn init -2
yarn set version stable
```


## TypeScript

tsconfig.json in the root defines the paths for packages we want to be able to import elsewhere, e.g. to allow service '
foobar' to import the logger

tsconfig-build.json is our base config (could have called it tsconfig-base.json or whatever. Not sure why I put build?).
It is extended by each service's tsconfig, and defines the common config like target lib, module resolution options,
etc.

Each package's tsconfig is like the below:

```
{
  "extends: "../../tsconfig.build.json",
  "compilerOptions": {
    "rootDir": "./src",
    "outDir": "./dist"
  },
  "include": [
    "src/**/*"
  ]
}
```

For each package's tsconfig, we have to declare the rootDir, outDir and include properties. They canâ€™t be hoisted in the
root config because they are resolved relative to the config they are in.

**TODO:**

it would be better if we didn't need an explicit entry for every package in the root tsconfig.json so that packages just
got detected automatically.

## packages

### common

exports a string

should be importable by other packages

### foobar

like a pretend service, imports the logger and the string from common and logs the string

### logger

exports a logger function, should be importable everywhere

## TODO

make a new branch and get rid of lerna, see if we can manage the build process above with just yarn

maybe try yarn 2?
